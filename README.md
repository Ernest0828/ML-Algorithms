# Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the implmentation of 4 widely used ML Algorithms:
1. Linear Regression: applied onto a trajectory issue. 
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): applied onto a blood dataset
3. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN): applied on predictign the joint angles of a robots end-effector position (Inverse Kinematics)
4. Gradient Descent (GD): applied onto a potential path field for a robot

Before running them, please ensure you have these installed:
- _pip install scikit-learn_
- _pip install torch_
- _pip install numpy pandas matplotlib_
